                <h2>What is <span>Mental Health</span></h2>
                <p>Mental health is the state of an individual's emotional, psychological, and social well-being. It
                    encompasses every thought, emotion, and action that affects a person's ability to deal with stress,
                    communicate with others, and make decisions. Good mental health is characterized by resilience,
                    balance, and the capacity to overcome adversities in life. It might be influenced by a wide range of
                    factors, such as genetics, environment, and life experiences. </p>

                    more prone to illness. In the same way, when we're physically tired, our minds suffer. </p>
