                <h2>Vitamins</h2>
                <p>  Vitamins are crucial for various biochemical processes in our bodies. For example, a deficiency in Vitamin A can cause night blindness, affecting our vision in low light conditions. Eating a balanced diet generally provides sufficient vitamins, and in most cases, taking additional supplements is unnecessary unless specifically recommended for health reasons</p>

                <h2>Minerals</h2>
                <p>  Similar to vitamins, minerals are vital for regulating bodily processes and making up body tissues. They contribute to maintaining our immune system, bone health, and many other essential functions. Some key minerals include calcium, iron, iodine, and copper, which can be found in foods like milk, nuts, whole grains, and vegetables. Just like vitamins, getting minerals from a well-rounded diet is usually sufficient.

                <h2>Water</h2>
                <p>   Water is arguably the most important nutrient. It constitutes around 70% of our body mass and is essential for various bodily functions. Water helps transport nutrients, remove waste, maintain body temperature, and provides structure to our cells. Staying hydrated is key to ensuring that these processes function smoothly.</p>
